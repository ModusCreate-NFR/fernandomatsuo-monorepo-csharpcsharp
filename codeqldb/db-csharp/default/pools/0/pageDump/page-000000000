            P:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.SlidingExpiration
            The SlidingExpiration is set to true to instruct the handler to re-issue a new cookie with a new
            expiration time any time it processes a request which is more than halfway through the expiration window.
            P:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.LoginPath
            The LoginPath property is used by the handler for the redirection target when handling ChallengeAsync.
            The current url which is added to the LoginPath as a query string parameter named by the ReturnUrlParameter.
            Once a request to the LoginPath grants a new SignIn identity, the ReturnUrlParameter value is used to redirect
            the browser back to the original url.
            P:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.LogoutPath
            If the LogoutPath is provided the handler then a request to that path will redirect based on the ReturnUrlParameter.

            The AccessDeniedPath property is used by the handler for the redirection target when handling ForbidAsync.
            P:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.ReturnUrlParameter
            The ReturnUrlParameter determines the name of the query string parameter which is appended by the handler
            during a Challenge. This is also the query string parameter looked for when a request arrives on the login
            path or logout path, in order to return to the original url after the action is performed.
            P:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.Events
            The Provider may be assigned to an instance of an object created by the application at startup time. The handler
            calls methods on the provider which give the application control at certain points where processing is occurring.

             P:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.SessionStore
            An optional container in which to store the identity across requests. When used, only a session identifier is sent
            to the client. This can be used to mitigate potential problems with very large identities.
            
            Controls how much time the authentication ticket stored in the cookie will remain valid from the point it is created.
            The expiration information is stored in the protected cookie ticket. Because of that an expired cookie will be ignored
            even if it is passed to the server after the browser should have purged it.

             Hosts start off by being registered using .
            
             In the simplest of cases, the client disconnects e.g. the user is done with the application and closes the browser.
             The server (eventually) learns of the disconnect. The host is transitioned from  to
              where it sits with an expiration time. We'll mark the associated  as disconnected
             so that consumers of the Circuit know of the current state.
             Once the entry for the host in  expires, we'll dispose off the host.
            
             The alternate case is when the disconnect was transient, e.g. due to a network failure, and the client attempts to reconnect.
             We'll attempt to connect it back to the host and the preserved server state, when available. In this event, we do the opposite of
             what we did during disconnect - transition the host from , and transfer
             the  to use the new client instance that attempted to reconnect to the server. Removing the entry from
              should ensure we no longer have to concern ourselves with entry expiration.
            
             Knowing when a client disconnected is not an exact science. There's a fair possibility that a client may reconnect before the server realizes.
             Consequently, we have to account for reconnects and disconnects occuring simultaneously as well as appearing out of order.
             To manage this, we use a critical section to manage all state transitions.

             This is designed with both server-side and client-side perf in mind:
            
              * Array-like regions always have a fixed size per entry (even if some entry types
                don't require as much space as others) so the recipient can index directly.
              * The indices describing where field data starts, where each string value starts,
                etc., are written *after* that data, so when writing the data we don't have to
                compute the locations up front or seek back to an earlier point in the stream.
                The recipient can only process the data after reading it all into a buffer,
                so it's no disadvantage for the location info to be at the end.
              * We only serialize the data that the JS side will need. For example, we don't
                emit frame sequence numbers, or any representation of nonstring attribute
                values, or component instances, etc.
            
             We don't have or need a .NET reader for this format. We only read it from JS code.

             be implemented to work across all render modes. Component authors should only specify
             a fixed rendering mode when the component is incapable of running in other modes.

             Route precedence algorithm.
             We collect all the routes and sort them from most specific to
             less specific. The specificity of a route is given by the specificity
             of its segments and the position of those segments in the route.
             * A literal segment is more specific than a parameter segment.
             * A parameter segment with more constraints is more specific than one with fewer constraints
             * Segment earlier in the route are evaluated before segments later in the route.
             For example:
             /Literal is more specific than /Parameter
             /Route/With/{parameter} is more specific than /{multiple}/With/{parameters}
             /Product/{id:int} is more specific than /Product/{id}
            
             Routes can be ambiguous if:
             They are composed of literals and those literals have the same values (case insensitive)
             They are composed of a mix of literals and parameters, in the same relative order and the
             literals have the same values.
             For example:
             * /literal and /Literal
             /{parameter}/literal and /{something}/literal
             /{parameter:constraint}/literal and /{something:constraint}/literal
            
             To calculate the precedence we sort the list of routes as follows:
             * Shorter routes go first.
             * A literal wins over a parameter in precedence.
             * For literals with different values (case insensitive) we choose the lexical order
             * For parameters with different numbers of constraints, the one with more wins
             If we get to the end of the comparison routing we've detected an ambiguous pair of routes.

             YY and ZZ are undefined.
             
             This method allows for a slight performance improvement over IAuthenticatedEncryptor.Encrypt
             in the case where the caller needs to prepend or append some data to the resulting ciphertext.
             For instance, if the caller needs to append a 32-bit header to the resulting ciphertext, then
             specify 4 for 'preBufferSize' and overwrite the first 32 bits of the buffer returned
             by this function. This saves the caller from having to allocate a new buffer to hold the final
             transformed result.

            developer to configure default cryptographic algorithms, key storage locations,
            and the mechanism by which keys are protected at rest.
            
            If the developer changes the at-rest key protection mechanism, it is intended that
            they also change the key storage location, and vice versa. For instance, a call to
             should generally be accompanied by
            a call to , or exceptions may
            occur at runtime due to the data protection system not knowing where to persist keys.
            
            Similarly, when a developer modifies the default protected payload cryptographic
            algorithms, they should also set an explicit key storage location.
            A call to 
            should therefore generally be paired with a call to ,
